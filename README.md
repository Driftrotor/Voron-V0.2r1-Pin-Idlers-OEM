# Voron V0.2r1 Pin Idlers OEM
 Pin Mod to enhance your V0 experience

Working on the principle of "if the bigger printers can have it, why can't we?!" this led me to create a way to have "PINS" on the V0.
Having created the First Version of a PIN MOD i wanted something that was more in keeping with the OEM standards.
So rather than having some fully custom print parts i stuck rigidly with the Original Parts for the V0. After working some magic it has been made to print easily while retaining strength and helping to seal the chamber from draughts. Location Pins at the top on the Lower Printed parts help with alignment so installation is now made easier.

you will require some 3mm x 28mm silver steel pins to use this mod.

> The holes for the pins are of tight tollerence and you may need to reem them out for good fitment.

I have found that when printing these with other tollerences that the pins were not as secure, so over time they would become loose in the printed parts. This is obviously not very desireable as we want this mod to be as reliable as possible. Having printed with a tight tollerence and reeming out the holes i have run well over 400 print hours in chamber temps exceeding 60 degrees and the pins are as snug as day one!
